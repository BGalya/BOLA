Due to time limitations and the time spent on completing the previous tasks, I wasn’t able to fully complete Task 4:
Detecting Potential BOLA Attacks on my own.
As I was running out of time, I decided to use ChatGPT to help generate the program.
While I integrated the generated code into my project, I didn’t have the time to thoroughly understand and adapt it to
my specific needs, so the solution provided is not entirely my own work.
While the solution provided is functional, I recognize that it lacks the depth and understanding I would have applied if
I had more time to work on it myself.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project. I encountered some challenges along the way, but I believe this
experience has significantly expanded my knowledge.
